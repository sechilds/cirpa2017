# CIRPA 2017 Workshop

I have discovered something - you can use macros in `vim` mode in RStudio.
That is pretty cool.

## Outline

* Loading data (review)
* Loading survey data
* Manipulating survey data - for easier vizualization and analysis.
* descriptive statistics (means, medians, etc.)
* exploratory data visualization (with `ggplot2`)
* the R formula language
* statistical tests
* the `broom` package - cleaning up results
* statistical modeling
* categorical data
* predictive models/machine learning
* descriptive models/econometrics
* outputting results

I want to think about some concept maps for this stuff.
There are quite a few topics here, and I want to catch them all.

### Loading Data

This might be a review of stuff that Evan has talked about.

* reading data from CSV files with `read_csv`
* reading data from Excel files (ASK EVAN)
* reading data from SPSS files with `haven`

### Loading Survey Data

Survey data can be a bit of a special case because of the associated metadata around the survey.
You want to have that metadata, but it can be difficult to process.

I will talk about `haven` and how you can use it to load up SPSS data -- and how you can
grab things out of the resulting data frame with `labelled`.

### Manipulating Survey Data for Ease of Analysis

I want to talk about how you might use `dplyr` to layout the data in a more efficient way.
The challenge of this is that it makes the data quite large.
And I only really want a simple version of this.

I'm not sure I can talk about weights.

### Descriptive Statistics

When you have basic data loaded, you want to get all sorts of descriptive statistics out of there.
So, there are lots of built in functions that will do that for you.

I want to look at the difference between the base and dplyr functions.
Actually, the `mean` function you use with `summarise` is the same as the base function.
That is actually intersting.

## Exploratory Data Viz

You want to start out with some simple data vizualization to get a sense of what things look like

```{r}
df %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = t1_y1))
```















This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
