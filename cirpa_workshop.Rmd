# CIRPA 2017 Workshop

I have discovered something - you can use macros in `vim` mode in RStudio.
That is pretty cool.

## Outline

* Loading data (review)
* Loading survey data
* descriptive statistics (means, medians, etc.)
* exploratory data visualization (with `ggplot2`)
* the R formula language
* statistical tests
* the `broom` package - cleaning up results
* statistical modeling
* categorical data
* predictive models/machine learning
* descriptive models/econometrics
* outputting results

I want to think about some concept maps for this stuff.
There are quite a few topics here, and I want to catch them all.
















This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
